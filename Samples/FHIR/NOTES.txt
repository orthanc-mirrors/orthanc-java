This sample Java plugin runs a FHIR server based on the HAPI library.
Note that contrarily to the other samples that can run using Java 1.8,
this Java plugin requires Java 11.

(1) Make sure to build the C++ plugin:

# cd ../../Plugin/
# mkdir Build
# cd Build
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# make -j4


(2) Compile the Java plugin using Maven:

# cd ../../Samples/FHIR
# mvn package


(3) Start Orthanc:

On Ubuntu 22.04:

# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/lib/server/ Orthanc ./configuration.json
